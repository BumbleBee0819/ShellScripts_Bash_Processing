# This code will delete every n-th file in a folder

# Example:
# Input: vid0.txt, vid1.txt, vid2.txt, vid3.txt, vid4.txt, vid5.txt, vid6.txt
# Output: vid0.txt, vid3.txt, vid6.txt


# NOTICE:
# 1) By default, the files should be sequentially names (i.e. vid0.txt, vid1.txt, vid2.txt).
#    If your files are not named like this, you need to edit the lines "if [ ! -f vid$j.txt ] then"
# 2ï¼‰ By default, this code will remove all files whose filenames are not divisible by 3 (output example: vid0, vid3, vid6)
